            <p>Learning the alphabet and numbers can be difficult! But through our game, your child will quickly adapt the skillset needed to recognize letters and drawing these.

                With our interactive game, the children will learn the alphabet and numbers in a fun and creating way. Allowing the children to learn by engaging several senses and making it easier to remember. Trough hearing, seeing, drawing and repetition the children will quickly learn the alphabet.
                Seeing the letter in a fun and engaging way and by hearing each of the unique sounds each letter makes will reinforce the letter recognition skills, which is crucial for early readers. During all this you are accompanied by your friendly companion ( navnet på figuren ), who navigates and helps you through the game.

                Another important aspect is that the children will not look at this as homework, but rather a fun game!
