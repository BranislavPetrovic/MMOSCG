            <p>Learning the alphabet and numbers can be a challange. But through our game, your child will quickly aquire and hone the skillset needed to recognize letters and draw them.

                With our interactive game, the children will learn the alphabet and numbers in a fun and interactive way. By engaging the child through hearing, seeing and touch, it will make it easier for the child to remember and repeat the lessons learned by our interactive memory game.
                Seeing the letter in a fun and engaging way and by hearing each of the unique sounds each letter makes will reinforce their letter recognition skills, which is crucial for early readers. During all this you are accompanied by your friendly companion ( navnet på figuren ), who navigates and helps you through the game.

                Another important aspect is that the children will not look at this as homework, but rather a fun game!
