                <p class="text">Being able to read and write are essential for achieving knowledge and adapting new skill sets. Which not only gives our society the opportunity to move forward, but also increase our quality of life. Sadly, some children are being denied the opportunity of going to an elementary school and learn the basic sets of writing and reading.</p>
                <p class="text"> We believe educational games are a new and fun way for children to learn! With our app EasyLearn we want to give these children exactly the opportunity to learn the basics of wrting and reading.</p>

                    Learning the alphabet and numbers can be difficult! But through our game, your child will quickly adapt the skillset needed to recognize letters and drawing these.
                </p>
                <p class="text">

                    With our interactive game, the children will learn the alphabet and numbers in a fun and creating way. Allowing the children to learn by engaging several senses and making it easier to remember. Trough hearing, seeing, drawing and repetition the children will quickly learn the alphabet.

                <p class="text">
                    Seeing the letter in a fun and engaging way and by hearing each of the unique sounds each letter makes will reinforce the letter recognition skills, which is crucial for early readers. During all this you are accompanied by your friendly companion ( navnet på figuren ), who navigates and helps you through the game.

                <p class="text">
                    Another important aspect is that the children will not look at this as homework, but rather a fun game!

                    In this game the child will put into use what the learned during the first game. Starting to piece together letters to create shorter words in the begging, as they advance the words will become gradually longer, and tougher to spell.

                <p class="text">

                    The game lets the children see a picture of a familiar object and see how it’s spelled. As well as hearing the unique sound of each letter, and how the words are being pronounced. Then getting tasked to choose from a given set of letters, and using these to spell the correct word. When a letter is chosen the child gets to hear the letter.

                <p class="text">
                    This way we once again engage several senses at once, giving the children the opportunity to associate each individual letter with its unique sound and the pronunciations of the words.
