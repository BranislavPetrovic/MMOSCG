          Being able to read and write are essential for achieving
          knowledge and adapting new skill sets. Which not
          only gives our society the opportunity to move
          forward, but also increase our quality of life.
          Sadly, some children are being denied the
          opportunity of going to an elementary school
          and learn the basic sets of writing and reading.
          We believe educational games are a new and fun way for
          children to learn! With our app EasyLearn we want
          to give these children exactly the opportunity
          to learn the basics of writing and reading.
        </p>

    <div class="textBox1" id="ezABC">
          <h1>The easy ABC´s & Numbers</h1>
          <p>
            Learning the alphabet and numbers can be difficult!
            But through our game, your child will quickly adapt
            the skillset needed to recognize letters and drawing these.
          </p>
          <p>
            With our interactive game, the children will learn the alphabet
            and numbers in a fun and creating way. Allowing the children to
            learn by engaging several senses and making it easier to remember.
            Trough hearing, seeing, drawing and repetition the children will
            quickly learn the alphabet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing the letter in a fun and engaging way and
            by hearing each of the unique sounds each letter makes
            will reinforce the letter recognition skills, which is
            crucial for early readers. During all this you are accompanied
            by your friendly companion ( navnet på figuren ), who navigates
            and helps you through the game.
          </p>
          <p>
              Another important aspect is that the children will not
              look at this as homework, but rather a fun game!
          </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBox2" id="champ">
      <h1>Spelling champ!</h1>
      <p>
        In this game the child will put into use what the learned during
        the first game. Starting to piece together letters to create
        shorter words in the begging, as they advance the words will
        become gradually longer, and tougher to spell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game lets the children see a picture of a familiar object
        and see how it’s spelled. As well as hearing the unique sound
        of each letter, and how the words are being pronounced. Then getting
        tasked to choose from a given set of letters, and using these to
        spell the correct word. When a letter is chosen
        the child gets to hear the letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way we once again engage several senses at once,
        giving the children the opportunity to associate each individual
        letter with its unique sound and the pronunciations of the words.
